        <p>They were originally to hero as well as guard flocks of sheep.
        And they were often left to their own devices in order to accomplish their assigned task.
        This makes the Briard different from those breeds that only guard and those that only heard.
        The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size agile, and swift of foot.These breeds that just guard are usually larger and heavier.
        Briards were used in all types of herding situation, having the ability to learn many commands and fulfill the jobs expected of them.
        The briard was most commonly used as a farm dog in the more crowded farming valleys of France,
        where row crops were grown. Sheep were allowed to graze the grass strips between crops and Briards were responsible for keeping the sheep moving along these strips, and preventing the sheep from eating the crops.
        The Briard moved the sheep daily from farm to the graze areas and back again at night.</p>
